# Module: github-master

Opt-in. Inverts the source of truth: **GitHub Issues become the master**, and
the file registry becomes a mirror of them — *without* putting the network into
CI. Use this only when your backlog genuinely lives on GitHub. With this module
off (the default), the registry stays the source of truth and nothing here runs.

Depends on `feature-registry` (the mirror lives in the story files) and
`github-issues` (the issue refs are the join key).

## Two layers — never mix them

| Layer | What | Network | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sync** (`gh_sync.py`) | pull issues → the committed snapshot | yes | a tool you run (or wire into a network job); never the gate job |
| **Gate** (`check_github_master.py`) | registry ↔ snapshot consistency, master invariants | **no** | offline, deterministic, over the committed snapshot |

Truth flows GitHub → snapshot → (checked against) registry. On divergence,
**GitHub wins** — re-run the sync and commit the refreshed snapshot. The snapshot
is the offline stand-in for GitHub truth, so the gate stays hermetic exactly like
every other gate in the process.

## Staleness — the one caveat that matters

The gate is deterministic over the *committed* snapshot and has **no network and
no clock**, so it **cannot detect a stale snapshot**: if the registry and the
snapshot agree with each other but both lag GitHub, the gate passes green. "GitHub
is master" therefore means *master as of the last `gh_sync` you ran and committed*
— nothing forces or verifies freshness. The gate surfaces this every run as a note
showing the snapshot's `generated_at`; keeping the mirror fresh is your discipline.
No sync CI job ships (it needs GitHub auth + `project` scope); wiring one that runs
`gh_sync`/`gh_board` and commits, or refuses to merge on a stale stamp, is an
adopter recipe, not part of this module.

## The snapshot

`gh_sync.py` writes `.process-work/github-snapshot.json` (commit it):

```json
{
  "generated_by": "gh_sync",
  "generated_at": "2026-07-04T12:00:00Z",
  "issues": [
    {"number": 42, "story": "STORY-0001", "title": "…",
     "state": "open", "status": "in-progress",
     "blocked_by": null, "parent": null, "board_status": null}
  ]
}
```

- `story` is the join key — filled from each story's `issue` ref. An issue with
  no story yet is reported by the sync (and flagged by the gate) so you
  materialize a story for it.
- `state` is GitHub open/closed; `status` is the process status (from a
  `status:*` label, else derived).
- `blocked_by` / `parent` / `board_status` are **nullable slots**, each
  drift/consistency-checked *when non-null* (sequencing, sub-issues, the project
  board); `null` ⇒ the gate skips it. Which populator fills which slot today is
  explicit: `gh_board.py` fills `board_status`; **`gh_sync.py` writes
  `blocked_by` and `parent` as `null`** — populating them from GitHub issue
  relationships / the sub-issues API is an extension point, so those two drift
  checks are live capability that only fires once you (or a future populator)
  write the slot. The gate is honest either way — it never invents a value.

## What the gate enforces (all offline)

- **Hard:** a malformed snapshot; a live (non-`deprecated`) story with no `issue`
  ref (the master requires every live story to trace to an issue); a story with
  no snapshot entry, or a snapshot entry with no story (the mirror must be
  complete both ways); **drift** where the registry disagrees with the snapshot
  on `title`, on `status` (both the value and its open/closed projection), or on
  a non-null `blocked_by` / `parent`; an **in-progress story whose issue is not
  Ready** (see below).
- **Best-effort (note):** no snapshot yet — expected before the first sync; a
  snapshot entry predating the `dor` slot (re-sync to enforce the DoR).

**Definition of Ready, enforced.** `gh_sync.py` is the one place that sees the
live issue, so it derives the DoR facts there and stores them in the entry's
`dor` slot: `typed` (a `type:*` label — R1), `ears` (an EARS acceptance section,
heading or `shall` clause, case-insensitive; an epic is exempt — R2), and
`deviation` (the body records a `## Deviations` note — the DoR's named escape,
`definition-of-ready-and-done.md`). The gate then enforces, offline: a story at
`in-progress` (work has started) whose issue is neither Ready nor carries a
deviation **fails hard** — the DoR moves from checklist to gate. `proposed` is
not yet started and `done` is the review gate's business; both stay out of
scope. The body itself is never snapshotted, only the derived booleans.

Status↔state mapping the gate checks: `done` ⇒ issue **closed**;
`proposed`/`in-progress` ⇒ issue **open**; `deprecated` ⇒ either (and exempt
from the issue/snapshot invariants — retired work need not trace to a live
issue).

## Workflow

1. Create/modify the issue on GitHub (the master).
2. `python scripts/process/gh_sync.py` → refreshes the snapshot; materialize a
   story for any orphan issue it reports.
3. Commit the snapshot (and any new story). The gate then verifies, offline,
   that the mirror matches — in CI and locally.

## Project board

A GitHub Project board (Backlog → Ready → In-progress → Review → Done) is
supported the same two-layer way: `gh_board.py` (network) fills the snapshot's
`board_status`; the gate checks it offline. The one canonical mapping:

| board column | story `status` | issue `state` |
|---|---|---|
| Backlog, Ready | `proposed` | open |
| In-progress, Review | `in-progress` | open |
| Done | `done` | closed |

Columns match case-insensitively; `deprecated` stories are off the board
(exempt). The gate **hard-fails** an unknown column or a column whose implied
status disagrees with the story — so column, status, and issue state stay
mutually consistent, all offline. `gh_board.py <project-number> [--owner OWNER]`
reads the board into the snapshot (this half is real). `--push` is a **deliberate
no-op extension point**: moving a card is a GitHub write that needs your project's
Status-field and option ids, so the tool refuses to guess — it prints a notice and
moves nothing until you wire it. Card *movement is not shipped*; column *reading*
and *consistency gating* are.

## The alternative

The registry-master default: leave this module off and author stories directly;
GitHub, if used at all, is then a projection (see the `github-issues` module),
not the master.
